## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Raaif and I am a final year graduate student in quantitative finance at the Vienna University of Economics and Business. I want a pursue a career in quantitative risk & trading. Here, on GitHub, I like sharing some interesting projects I have worked at school, and also some self inspired projects. I am currently working on developing a project to show case my skills in quantitative risk analytics.
